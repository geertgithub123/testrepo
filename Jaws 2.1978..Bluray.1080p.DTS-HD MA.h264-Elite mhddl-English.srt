00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,973
Jesus.

324
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,233
What do you think?

325
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,901
First things first.

326
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,529
Tip of the snout, please.

327
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,253
Length? Seven
and a half meters.

328
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,422
Seven and a half meters.

329
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,798
ELKINS: Correct.

330
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,766
You better check
the bite radius.

331
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,809
The what?
The shape of the mouth.

332
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,145
The whale's mouth?

333
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,438
Shark's mouth.

334
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,814
What shark?

335
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,441
The shark that did this.

336
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,152
But we don't
know that, do we?

337
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,154
That's what we're
here to find out.

338
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,322
And we will.

339
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,866
Now, I can't hear you if
you're going to whisper.

340
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,868
111 centimeters.

341
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,620
HENDRICKS: 111 centimeters.

342
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,704
Sixty-eight.

343
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,789
HENDRICKS: Sixty-eight.

344
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,958
I have had some
experience with sharks.

345
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,460
Oh, have you?

346
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,045
Yeah, and I think...

347
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,798
I think a great white
might've done this.

348
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,424
Carcharodon carcharias?

349
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,717
Right.

350
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,554
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

351
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,473
Well, it's obvious that...

352
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,726
That a big fish took
a bite outta this big fish.

353
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,479
This is a mammal,
not a fish.

354
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,232
Don't quibble with me. Is
it a shark bite or isn't it?

355
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,733
Possibly.

356
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,236
Then again,
this is a killer whale.

357
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,113
It would have to be a
shark of considerable size.

358
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,454
Look, we know that sharks
are attracted by blood

359
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,789
and thrashing about.

360
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,207
And sound.

361
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,834
Sound?

362
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,836
Sound. Like
sonar or radar.

363
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,005
They hone in on unusual
sounds, irregular sounds,

364
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,967
almost any rhythmic
low-frequency vibration.

365
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,844
That means that there
could be one around.

366
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,345
Not necessarily.

367
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,348
These wounds could have been
inflicted 15 miles out to sea or more.

368
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,433
None of them were
immediately fatal.

369
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,519
Currents could have carried
the body 10 miles further.

370
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,312
HENDRICKS: We got a hell
of a tide this month.

371
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,565
Will you just take care
of the crowd, please?

372
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,691
Dad?

373
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,694
Mr. Hendricks, will you
take this down, please?

374
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,030
No more sailing
today, okay?

375
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,407
And I'd like you to
come back with me.

376
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,575
We came out in my boat.

377
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,826
Yeah, but Andy'll
take it back!

378
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,828
I got a date.
She'll understand.

379
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,037
No, she won't.

380
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,164
Mike, for Christ's sakes,
give me a break here, will you?

381
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,041
ELKINS:
Seventy-two centimeters,

382
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,877
allowing for
salt water erosion

383
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,005
and subsequent small
predator tissue attacks.

384
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,675
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

385
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,176
Well, I'd like
to know which.

386
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,846
Well, it's impossible for me to
tell when the body's like this.

387
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,140
This animal has been
ashore for 10 or 12 hours

388
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,475
and drifting
for a day at least.

389
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,978
Every little nibbler in
the sea's taken a bite.

390
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,899
I know that
dolphins communicate.

391
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,483
I mean, they send signals.

392
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,069
You don't think that
if a shark was destroyed,

393
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,280
that another shark could...
Could come and...

394
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,158
Sharks don't take things
personally, Mr. Brody.

395
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,123
Dad, can I please take my... No!

396
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,502
Hey, look, don't
worry about it.

397
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,338
I'll take it back and
tie it up at the dock.

398
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,131
Bye, Mike, see you later. I'm sorry.

399
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,717
It'll be okay, Mike. I'll
see you tomorrow. All right?

400
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,844
MIKE: I appreciate it. Thanks.

401
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,878
Larry? Larry,
wait a minute.

402
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,965
LARRY: I'm showing
summer rentals.

403
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,550
I think we have a hell of
a good season going for us.

404
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,136
That's swell, Larry, but I
have to talk to you alone.

405
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,471
We're alone.

406
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,142
I think we may have
another shark problem.

407
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,688
Are you serious?

408
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,731
You bet I'm serious.

409
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,859
I've got a half-eaten
whale out on the beach.

410
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,695
I've got two persons missing.

411
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,155
This whale has got a bite
out of it about this big.

412
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,075
Martin, no one has seen
a shark. Be realistic.

413
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,160
BRODY: I think the selectmen
should know about it.

414
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,288
I know it's just a feeling,
but you've got to understand.

415
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,584
Larry, for Christ sakes,
I not only have this attack,

416
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,837
but I've got... I've got
two water skiers who have...

417
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,631
A tragedy.
But a boating accident.

418
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,091
No fin, no sharks,

419
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,592
nothing but
a boating accident.

420
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,844
But their boat's
still missing.

421
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:37,431
We have a lot of deaths in
these waters that never turn up.

422
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,810
Are they all
shark victims?

423
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,104
Maybe they are.

424
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,814
Oh, bullshit!

425
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,065
Bullshit?

426
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,485
Is it bullshit I got a whale on the
beach with a bite in it this big?

427
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,279
What am I, an ass?

428
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,950
When you called me, I
called Elkins and her bosses.

429
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,454
Nothing she saw is
proof of anything.

430
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,917
So that means we're not
gonna do anything, huh?

431
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,172
Martin, don't press
it this time.

432
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,427
Well, I've got to
get back to work.

433
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,223
Okay.

434
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,601
Okay, Larry, but you just
remember this conversation.

435
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,061
You just remember it!

Chief? Hi.

441
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,778
Missed you at
the funeral home.

Yeah. Christ,
what a mess.

You didn't miss much.

it was the woman

all right.

Thank you, operator,
just keep trying.

Nothing.

I think we ought to keep
sight-seers away from there.

Did you take a look
at that stuff in that box?

No.

456

How about that camera?

00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,416
Might be
something in it.

Yeah, right.

Why don't you take it over to
Fogarty's and get it developed?

I'll do it first
thing in the morning.

send it over to the house, all right?

dragged a body outta the ocean today.

for you to do tomorrow.

00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,029
You're dammed
right it's your ass!

641
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,947
Now, uh, be
reasonable. Please.

642
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,365
Reasonable with what?
With him?

643
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,742
God damn it, will you listen to the man?

644
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,327
Will you just
listen to him?

645
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,745
Be reasonable?

646
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,371
Look, Brody,

647
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,373
you started a panic
on a public beach.

648
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,167
You shot up
the damn place!

649
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,835
God knows who you
could've injured.

650
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,462
Now, what if somebody decides to sue us?

651
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,255
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

652
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,965
It could ruin us!

653
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,218
You don't have to worry about
being sued, or being ruined.

654
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,802
If this turns out to
be what I think it is,

655
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,221
because there
won't be anybody here.

656
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,889
Yeah. Now, Martin,
let's not, uh...

657
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,307
Let's not what?
Larry, what?

658
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,559
Oh, Jesus. Larry, huh, come
on? Let's just forget it!

659

He won't listen!

660
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,562
Now, it's obvious the
man has made up his mind.

661
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,231
You bet your life
I've made up my mind.

662
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,233
But I'm telling you, and
I'm telling everybody

663
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,901
at this table that
that's a shark!

664
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,277
And I know what
a shark looks like,

665
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,654
because I've
seen one up close.

666
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,239
And you'd better do
something about this one,

667
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,491
because I don't intend
to go through that hell again!

669
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,335
could you wait
here for a minute?

670
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,504
For what?

671
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,547
Please, just have a seat

672
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,134
while we look at the picture
and make up our own minds.

00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,225
BRODY: All right.

674
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,978
I'll have a seat.

675

Hey, did he really freak
out on the town beach?

I don't know.

it's all bullshit, anyway.

Hey, Ellen,

685
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,140
you know this is
the only dump in town

(MOCK LAUGHING)

go to the lighthouse?

spend the day?

My dad left a couple of

00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,740
Well, it's kind of

you gonna go?

Yeah, why not?

697
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,247
Because you might be
painting toilets at the beach.

Well, I'm not
sure I can go.

go out in my boat.

801
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,091
SEAN: Yeah!

802
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,761
You want him?
You can have him.

803
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,389
I think you just made
somebody very happy.

804
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,557
Hi, guys.
MIKE: Hi.

805
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,892
Mike, you going out?

806
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,727
Yeah. I thought you were grounded.

807
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,604
I can go out if I want to.

808
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:38,730
You can?

809
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,066
Is there enough room
for all of us on the boat?

810
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,651
Oh, I don't know, we're
a little over-crowded...

811
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,654
Oh, yeah, we got plenty of
room. Here, come on aboard.

812
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:46,863
I guess so.

813
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,617
Brooke, I've got room.

814
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,119
Great.

815
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,914
You'll go with me?
Sure.

816
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,167
Thanks, guys, but I'm
going with Timmy. Come on.

817
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,086
Fantastic.

818
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,005
That's a big mistake.

819
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,340
Don't worry
about it, all right?

820
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,259
Come on, you
guys, I'm ready.

821
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,723
Hey, I thought you said
she was comin' with us?

822
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,308
Obviously she's not.

823
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,103
You wanna talk about it?

824
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,813

supposed to be in class!

827

You dive for me.
I've got company.

828
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,541
I'm going for lobster!

829
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,126
Great! Bring me one!

830
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,295
I want mine
drawn with butter.

take you down today.

If everybody's ready,
let's buddy up and drop.

Get us in, for Christ sake! Get us in!

and keep him warm.

01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,353
So?

842
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:41,194
So I'll go down to the office, clean
out the desk, turn in the truck,

843
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:45,490
and maybe I'll get shitfaced and
rap your boss right in the mouth.

844
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,200
I think I better
give notice.

845

Take it easy.
We may need the income.

Mike's gone.

847
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,252
He's breaking out
early these days.

848
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,962
He must be a morning man.

849
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,672

Anything special today?

01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:10,932
No. Sean must be out
playing somewhere.

855

Why don't you let him
have whatever he wants?

Okay.

857
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,853
Just keep him away from the candy. Okay.

858
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,021
Am I still gonna
get my ride?

859

it pointed up like this?

way to Budapest if you're not careful.

be there when we get there.

gonna have to think of something.
